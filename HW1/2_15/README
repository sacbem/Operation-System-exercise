int copy_file(char FileSou[], char FileDest[])

This function uses the FileSou parameter as the path and name of the source file,
and the FileDest parameter as the path and name of the destination file.
When the function successfully copies the source file to the destination file,
it returns 0,

int main()

This function is used to test the copy_file() function,
copying the ./test.txt file to the ./testT.txt file.
