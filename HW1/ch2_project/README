Linux Kernel Module -- birthday 
============
Project Description
This project is a simple implementation of a linked list in the Linux kernel. 
It allows the user to store and manipulate a list of birthdays, consisting of the month and year of each birthday, 
as well as the gender of the person.

Installation
This code can be compiled as a kernel module and inserted into the kernel using the insmod command. 
To build the module, navigate to the directory containing the source code and run the command make. 
This will generate a file called birthday.ko.

Installation cmd :
    sudo insmod birthday.ko
Unstallation cmd :
    sudo rmsmod birthday.ko
To insert the module into the kernel, use the command sudo insmod birthday.ko.

Usage
Once the module is inserted, it can be used to create a linked list of birthdays. The user can add birthdays to the list using the push function, delete birthdays using the delete function, and traverse the list using the Traversal function.
============

Makefile : 
This Makefile is used to build the kernel module birthday.ko. 
While the Makefile is provided as is, 
there are a few issues that may arise when executing it. 
These issues and possible solutions are described below:

Kernel source not found:
If the kernel source is not installed on the system, 
the Makefile will not be able to locate the necessary kernel headers to build the module. 
This can be resolved by installing the kernel headers for the running kernel version using the package manager for your distribution.

KDIR not set:
The Makefile relies on the KDIR environment variable to point to the kernel source directory. 
If KDIR is not set or is set incorrectly, the build process will fail. 
Make sure that KDIR is set to the correct path before running the make command.

Incorrect syntax:
Any typo or syntax error in the Makefile can cause the build process to fail. 
Make sure that the Makefile syntax is correct and that there are no typos.

Permission issues:
If you encounter a permission issue while running make, 
try running the command with sudo or as the root user.

Compiler version mismatch:
It is possible that the compiler version used to build the kernel headers and the one used to build the module are different. 
This can cause compilation errors. Ensure that the same version of the compiler is used to build both the kernel headers and the module.


If you encounter any other issues while running the Makefile, 
please refer to the kernel module documentation or seek assistance from the relevant support channels.

Functions
create_new_node(int month, int year, int gender)
This function creates a new node for the linked list, with the given month, year, and gender values.

push(struct_birthday* list, int month, int year, int gender)
This function adds a new node to the end of the linked list, with the given month, year, and gender values.

delete(struct_birthday* list, struct_birthday* node)
This function removes a node from the linked list, given a pointer to the node to be deleted.

Traversal(const struct_birthday* list)
This function traverses the linked list and prints out the month and year of each birthday.
